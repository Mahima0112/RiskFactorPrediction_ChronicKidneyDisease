# RiskFactorPrediction_ChronicKidneyDisease
CKD leads to progressive kidney failure. The project constructs a neural network model to forecast CKD risk based on patient information. It applies PCA, scaling, and tests with accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC. It aids early detection, although real-world testing is required.
